## Install
```sh
npm install -g licgen
```
_Or_
```sh
yarn add -g licgen
```

## Use
```sh
licgen [--type=mit]
```
If you have a license listed in your `package.json`, it will choose that license for you. If you don't, it will prompt you to choose a license.

Alternatively, choose your *own* license with the `type` argument.

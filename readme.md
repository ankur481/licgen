Generate a license for your project. All from the command line.

## Install
```sh
npm install -g licgen
```
_Or_
```sh
yarn add -g licgen
```

## Use
```sh
licgen (--type=<MIT>)
```

Automatically detects license type from package.json. Or, set `lic` equal to requested license type. If you don't know what you want, that's fine as well. Just follow the prompts.
